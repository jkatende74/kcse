                    <p>A wave is fundamentally the <strong>transmission of a disturbance</strong>. This disturbance propagates outwards from its point of origin, effectively transferring <strong>energy</strong> without causing a net movement of the medium itself from one location to another.</p>
                    <p>Waves play a significant role in various aspects of daily life, including radio and television transmission, mobile communication, remote control systems, and the transfer of heat energy via radiation.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Imagine dropping a pebble in a pond. The ripples that spread out are waves! A wave is basically a way energy travels through a disturbance, without the actual stuff (like water particles) moving far from its spot.",

                content: `
                    <p>Waves can be broadly categorized based on whether they require a medium for transmission:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Electromagnetic Waves:</strong> These waves <strong>do not need a material medium</strong> to travel. Examples include radio waves, radiant heat, light, and microwaves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Waves:</strong> These waves <strong>require a material medium</strong> through which to propagate. Their transmission occurs due to the vibration of the particles within that medium. Examples include water waves and sound waves.</li>
                    </ul>
                `,
                explanation: "There are two main wave families: 'Electromagnetic' waves (like light or radio waves) are special because they can travel through empty space (like from the Sun to Earth). 'Mechanical' waves (like sound or water waves) need some 'stuff' (a medium like air or water) to travel through.",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: Side-by-side comparison. Left: Sun emitting light waves traveling through space to Earth (Electromagnetic). Right: A person speaking, with sound waves traveling through air particles (Mechanical).]"

                title: "Types of Mechanical Waves: Transverse Waves",
                content: `
                    <p>Mechanical waves can be further subdivided into two types based on the direction of particle vibration relative to the wave's direction of travel.</p>
                    <h3>Transverse Waves:</h3>
                    <p>In a transverse wave, the <strong>vibration of the particles in the medium occurs at right angles (perpendicular)</strong> to the direction in which the wave is traveling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Water waves, waves moving along a stretched string or rope, and all electromagnetic waves (such as light, radio waves, and microwaves) are examples of transverse waves.</p>
                    <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> One way to visualize a transverse wave is by moving one end of a slinky spring or rope, which is stretched along a smooth surface and fixed at the other end, up and down at right angles to the spring or rope.</p>
                    <p><strong>Form:</strong> Transverse waves propagate as a series of <strong>crests</strong> (points of maximum upward displacement) and <strong>troughs</strong> (points of maximum downward displacement). In the context of water waves, a toy boat placed in the path of the ripples will bob up and down but will not be moved towards the edge of the pond.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "In 'Transverse' waves, the particles jiggle up and down (or side to side) while the wave itself moves forward. Think of doing 'the wave' in a stadium – people move up and down, but the wave travels around. Water waves and light waves are like this. They have high points (crests) and low points (troughs).",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A stretched rope or slinky spring. Show one end being moved up and down, creating a wave pattern with clearly labeled crests and troughs moving along the rope. Indicate particle motion (up/down) and wave direction (sideways) with arrows.]"

            {
                title: "Types of Mechanical Waves: Longitudinal Waves",
                content: `
                    <h3>Longitudinal Waves:</h3>
                    <p>In a longitudinal wave, the <strong>vibration of the particles in the medium is in a direction parallel</strong> to the direction of the wave's travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Sound waves are the primary example of longitudinal waves.</p>
                    <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Longitudinal waves can be demonstrated by vibrating one end of a slinky spring, fixed at the other end, with a back-and-forth motion along its length.</p>
                    <p><strong>Form:</strong> This to-and-fro movement creates regions where the particles are pushed closer together, called <strong>compressions</strong>, alternating with regions where the particles are pulled farther apart, called <strong>rarefactions</strong>, along the length of the spring.</p>
                    <p><strong>Particle Spacing and Pressure:</strong> Longitudinal wave motion affects the spacing between particles; they are closer in compressions and farther apart in rarefactions. This variation in spacing is associated with a variation in pressure (higher in compressions, lower in rarefactions).</p>
                `,
                explanation: "In 'Longitudinal' waves, the particles jiggle back and forth in the SAME direction the wave is traveling. Think of pushing and pulling a slinky. Sound waves are like this. They have squished-up parts (compressions) and stretched-out parts (rarefactions).",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A slinky spring. Show one end being pushed and pulled, creating regions of compressions (coils close together) and rarefactions (coils spread apart) moving along the spring.

                    <h3>Progressive Waves:</h3>
                    <p>These are waves that <strong>continuously move away from their source</strong>. Both transverse and longitudinal waves can be progressive. As a progressive wave spreads out from its source, the energy it carries is distributed over an increasingly large area, which leads to a gradual decrease in the wave's <strong>amplitude</strong>.</p>
                    <h3>Pulses:</h3>
                    <p>A pulse is generated when a <strong>single vibration</strong> is introduced into a medium. Like progressive waves, pulses can be either transverse or longitudinal.</p>
                    <h3>Wave Trains:</h3>
                    <p>Wave trains are produced by <strong>continuous vibrations occurring at a steady rate</strong> within a medium. This results in a repeating pattern (crests/troughs or compressions/rarefactions).</p>
                `,
                explanation: "'Progressive waves' just keep on traveling away from where they started. A 'pulse' is like a single 'blip' or a single wave (like one flick of a rope). A 'wave train' is a whole series of these waves following each other, like continuous ripples.",

                content: `
                    <p>Understanding wave motion involves several key terms:</p>
                    <p><strong>Amplitude (A):</strong> The <strong>maximum displacement</strong> of a particle or point in the medium from its mean (equilibrium) position on either side. Its SI unit is the <strong>metre (m)</strong>. In a transverse wave, it is the height of a crest or the depth of a trough relative to the equilibrium line.</p>
                    <p><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The <strong>number of complete oscillations or cycles</strong> made by a vibrating particle or wave source in one second. The frequency of a wave is determined by the rate at which its source vibrates. The standard unit of frequency is the <strong>hertz (Hz)</strong> (cycles per second).</p>
                `,
                explanation: "'Amplitude' is how big the wave is – for water waves, it's how high the crest is from the calm water level. 'Frequency' is how many full waves pass by a point every second. We measure frequency in Hertz (Hz).",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A transverse wave. Clearly label the Amplitude (A) from the equilibrium line to a crest and also to a trough. Show multiple waves passing a point to illustrate frequency conceptually.]"

            {
                title: "Characteristics of Wave Motion: Period & Wavelength",
                content: `
                    <p><strong>Period (T):</strong> The <strong>time taken</strong> for a vibrating particle or wave to complete one full oscillation or cycle. The SI unit of period is the <strong>second (s)</strong>. Frequency and period are inversely related: <strong>f = 1/T</strong> and <strong>T = 1/f</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wavelength (λ):</strong> The <strong>distance between two points on a wave train that are in phase</strong>. More specifically, it is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs in a transverse wave, or the distance between two consecutive compressions or rarefactions in a longitudinal wave. The SI unit for wavelength is the <strong>metre (m)</strong>.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "'Period' is the time it takes for one complete wave to pass by. It's the flip side of frequency (T = 1/f). 'Wavelength' (shown by the Greek letter lambda, λ) is the distance from one crest to the next crest, or one trough to the next trough (or one compression to the next compression).",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A transverse wave. Clearly label the Wavelength (λ) as the distance between two consecutive crests. Also, show one complete cycle and label its duration as the Period (T). For a longitudinal wave, show λ as the distance between two consecutive compressions.]"

                content: `
                    <p><strong>Speed (v):</strong> The <strong>distance covered by a wave in one second</strong> as it travels through the medium. Its SI unit is <strong>metres per second (m/s)</strong>. For a given medium, the speed of a wave is generally considered constant.</p>
                    <h3>Phase and Phase Difference:</h3>
                    <p>Particles undergoing wave motion that are vibrating in the same direction and have the same instantaneous displacement from equilibrium are described as being <strong>in phase</strong>. Their displacement-time graphs would be identical. When particles are not in phase, they are described as being <strong>out of phase</strong>. For example, if one particle is at its maximum positive displacement while another is at its maximum negative displacement, they are 180° out of phase.</p>

                explanation: "'Wave speed' is simply how fast the wave is traveling. 'In phase' means two points on a wave are doing exactly the same thing at the same time (e.g., both at the top of a crest). 'Out of phase' means they are doing different things (e.g., one is at a crest, another is at a trough).",

                    <p>The speed (v) of a wave, its frequency (f), and its wavelength (λ) are related by a fundamental equation: <strong>v = fλ</strong></p>
                    <p>This equation indicates that the velocity of a wave is equal to the product of its frequency and wavelength. Since the speed of a wave is typically constant within a specific medium, this relationship shows that if the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease proportionally, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Waves on a spring: 20 wavelengths pass in 5s (f = 4 Hz). λ = 0.01 m. Speed v = fλ = 4 Hz × 0.01 m = 0.04 m/s. Period T = 1/f = 0.25 s.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Water wave travels 12 m in 4 s (v = 3 m/s). f = 2 Hz. Wavelength λ = v/f = 3 m/s / 2 Hz = 1.5 m.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Wave on a string: v = 10.0 m/s, λ = 40 cm (0.4 m). Frequency f = v/λ = 10.0 m/s / 0.4 m = 25 Hz. Period T = 1/f = 0.04 s.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "There's a super important formula connecting wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ):  v = f × λ.  This means if you know any two, you can find the third! If the speed in a material stays the same, then if frequency goes up, wavelength must go down, and vice-versa.",
